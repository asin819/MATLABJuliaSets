# MATLABJuliaSets
Using complex numbers and the concept of Julia sets to create artistic patterns 

The main file to run is AnimateJulia.
The colour of the animation can be set during runtime using a specified coloured map.
The pattern can be tweaked by changing the values of the complex numbers on line 18 and 19 in AnimateJulia.
Number of frames to generate is also a user option to be given at runtime.

Two example GIFs have been provided, named has BlackMagenta100 and Red. Both have different colour maps and complex number values.
